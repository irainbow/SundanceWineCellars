      <p>
        Oregon Wine Merchants is your online resource for accessing hard-to-find and allocated Oregon Pinot Noir.
        The “parent” business of Oregon Wine Merchants, Sundance Wine Cellars, began in 1983 and
        <b>currently houses the Northwest’s largest selection of wine, including over 500 different Oregon Pinot Noirs.</b>
        In addition to the Pinot Noirs we have on hand, we have access to <b>hundreds more</b>
        through our network of long-established relationships with Oregon wineries.

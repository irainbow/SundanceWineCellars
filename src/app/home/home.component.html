        Sundance Wine Cellars is the “parent” business of Oregon Wine Merchants. Our wine shop began in 1983 and
        currently houses the Northwest’s largest selection of wine, including over 500 different Oregon Pinot Noirs.
        In addition to the Pinots we have on hand in the shop, we have access to hundreds more
        through our network of long-established relationships with Oregon wineries.

        Please email, text or call us with any inquiries as to the availability of particular wines.
